## Todo List App
This is a simple Todo List app built with React. It allows you to add, toggle, and delete items from the list.

## Components
App.jsx: This component serves as the main entry point for the Todo List app. It manages the state of the todos and handles adding, toggling, and deleting todos.

TodoList.jsx: This component is responsible for rendering the list of todos. It receives the todos as props and renders each todo item with a checkbox to toggle completion and a delete button.

NewTodoForm.jsx: This component provides a form for adding new todos. It receives a callback function as a prop and calls it with the new todo item when the form is submitted.
